## 💡 About Me

<img align="right" alt="Coding" width="300" src="/api/placeholder/400/320" />

Hello! I'm Davi, an 18-year-old tech enthusiast from Brazil. My programming journey began at age 12 when I started creating maps and scripts for Roblox. Watching lines of code transform into functional elements sparked my passion for development.

I started with Lua by watching online tutorials, and soon realized that being a developer carries significant responsibilities. I even sold scripts when I was younger, which led me to study cybersecurity to protect my work and others'.

Over time, I've explored various tech areas:
- Automated tasks with Python
- Developed web applications
- Created APIs using Java and Spring Boot
- Completed freelance projects building websites and automating processes

I graduated as a Java fullstack developer from Instituto PROA, where I worked with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, MySQL, and Figma. I served as Product Owner for Symbee, a platform connecting companies with freelance developers.

What's exciting is that I never stop learning. I'm constantly deepening my knowledge and discovering new technologies.
